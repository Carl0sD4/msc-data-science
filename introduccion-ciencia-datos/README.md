# Learning log: my first steps with Git and GitHub

Over the past two days, I’ve been learning how to work with Git and GitHub. I’m not an expert by any means, but I don’t want my learning log to become a list of commands or functions that I could easily look up in documentation or ask ChatGPT about.

Instead, I want to document the understanding process — how I’m learning to use these tools. I’ve been following Mouredev’s course on YouTube and applying what I learn through small exercises.

It’s been really interesting to see how Git and GitHub will help me manage the different versions of my future projects during my master’s program.

At one point during the course, I found myself wondering: Aren’t there platforms that allow for more real-time editing — where my teammates and I could see each other’s changes instantly, similar to Google Docs? It seemed problematic to me that someone might be editing something without the rest of the team seeing it, as that could cause conflicts when merging or uploading code later.

So, I did some research and found tools like Visual Studio Code with Live Share, Replit, and CodeSandbox. However, I realized that their focus is on real-time collaboration, not version control.

As the course progressed, I began to understand why version control works the way it does — the importance of branches, the main branch, and how each "foto" (commit) generates a unique ID. Commands like git diff or git show help visualize what changed and where.

I already knew some basic terminal navigation, but this was a great refresher — and a perfect one, just a week before starting my master’s degree.

The whole learning experience — from navigating the terminal to submitting a Pull Request to add my name to the hello.md file — was very rewarding. I hope my request gets accepted (though I know there might be a small issue since others submitted theirs before me haha — those who took the course will get the joke).

That single exercise put everything I learned into practice. I plan to keep practicing, even while uploading this document, because this knowledge is now part of my journey. I just wanted to share it for the future.

Finally, I want to say I find the GitHub community and its core idea beautiful — the collaborative spirit, the structure it follows: contributing, requesting permission to modify, reviewing, approving or rejecting changes, and integrating code. It’s an elegant representation of how teamwork should work.
